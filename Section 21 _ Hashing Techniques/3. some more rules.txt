its the responsibility of a programmer to select a hash function such that
the hash table has values equally distributed and not clustered in some place !!
1. Double hashing :
       we select three or more functions such that if first one makes a collision then evaluate 
       through second or it both make collisions try their linear combination like
       h1(x) , h2(x) , h(x) = h1(x) + i*h2(x) , i=0,1,2,3....
       or we can use explicit function like h(h1(h2(x))) !! 

2. Standard hash functions :
       (a) Mod : h(x) = x%size ; size is generally taken as prime number !!
       (b) MidSquare = take middle digit of squared key !!
              ex : key = 11 -> 11^2 -> 121 -> middle digit is 2, so it's hash index is 2 !!
       (c) Folding : if key = 123345 then we can make parts of the key like 12,33,45 then add them 
                     to get the index !!!
